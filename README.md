## Current status

The website is temporarily hosted on a heicloud VM during development:

### User interface

This is the website that the end user would interact with (functionality is currently incomplete):

Until more functionality is added to the main site above, there are also some stand-alone previews of individual components:

- [Milestone component](https://mondey.lkeegan.dev/milestone)
- [MilestoneGroup component](https://mondey.lkeegan.dev/milestonegroup)

### Admin interface

This is the interface that admins would use to edit the contents of the website:

- [Mondey admin interface](https://mondey.lkeegan.dev/admin)

### Developer interface

These API interfaces are only temporarily public for convenience during development, in production these will not be public:

- [API documentation](https://mondey.lkeegan.dev/api/redoc)
- [Swagger UI to interact with API](https://mondey.lkeegan.dev/api/docs)
